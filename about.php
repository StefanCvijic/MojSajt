                    <h1>Hi, im Stefan.</h1>
                    <p> 
                        I'm 18 years old, born and raised in Bosnia and Herzegovina. To be exact in Gradiska a town from the entity Republic of Srpska.
                        My goal in life is to explore the world and see what it has to offer, and along my way to help others and finde love.
                        To bring happiness and joy to (my) people: friend, coworkers, strangers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Life is short. Do the things that make you happy and be around people that suit you.
                        I'ts a bit clishe but it is true life passes by in a moment. The next thing you know is that your children have grown and they are living their own life.
                        So make the best use of your time.
                    </p>
